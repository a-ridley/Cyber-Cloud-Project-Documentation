title: Load Admin Credentials
---

## Before you start:
0. you can load functions or variables from bash scripts into your workspace using `source <file>` or `. <file>` such as the . admin.sh script on the controller server
2. load functions from `power.sh` which contains utility methods used by our bootstrap scripts.
3. ~load configuration settings for your node usually called`<node_name>-config.sh`~ *deprecated*
4. _note:_ you can execute the inidivual commands from the bootstrap scripts from the command line as well once they are loaded.
