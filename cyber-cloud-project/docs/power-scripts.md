title: Load Admin Credentials
---

Before you start:
1. Load functions or variables from bash scripts into your workspace using `source <file>` or `. <file>` such as the . admin.sh script on the controller node located at `/root`
2. Load functions from `power.sh` which contains utility methods used by our bootstrap scripts. Located on the controller node `/root`
4. _note:_ you can execute the individual commands from the bootstrap scripts from the command line as well once they are loaded.
